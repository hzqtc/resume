# Resume

Johnny Huang's resume and related stuffs.

Resume data is stored in Markdown format and transformed into HTML using [Python-Markdown](https://github.com/waylan/Python-Markdown) and [Jinja](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2) template engine.

## Why Markdown?

I choose Markdown because it's simple and easy to manipulate. When transformed into HTML, you can make it look like whatever you want with the magic of CSS.

And you can use a virtual PDF printer to convert the HTML page into PDF. [doPDF](http://www.dopdf.com/) will be a good choice for Windows Users. And a built-in PDF printer is available for Linux version Firefox.

## Notice

You may use any resource in this project for your own use, too. But NEVER use any of my personal information because you are NOT me!
