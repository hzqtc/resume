# Resume

Johnny Huang's resume and related stuffs.

Resume data is stored in Markdown format and transformed into HTML. I choose Markdown because it's simple and easy to manipulate. When transformed into HTML, you can make it look like what you want with the magic of CSS.

And if you want a hard copy, print it! If you want a PDF version, print it through some virtual PDF printer. [doPDF](http://www.dopdf.com/) will be a good choice for Windows Users. And a built-in PDF printer is available for Linux version Firefox.

## Notice

This project is inspired by [icco/Resume](https://github.com/icco/Resume). And I took some resources as the base structure. You may use any resource in this project for your own use, too. But NEVER use any of my personal information because you are NOT me!
